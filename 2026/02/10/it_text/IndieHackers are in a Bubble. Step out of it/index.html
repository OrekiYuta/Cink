<p>I discovered the Indie Hacking community in March 2024 and got totally sucked in by the dream — build a small product, make a living online, while you are free and travel anywhere.</p>
<p>Building in public, fellow makers cheering on your small wins, supportive communities, growing a following - It all felt like I’d finally found my people.</p>
<p>But around 10 months in, something is starting to feel off.</p>
<p>It started to feel like it’s a weird kind of ponzi scheme — indie makers building tools for other indie makers, trying to sell shovels, selling the dream of build it fast and make money while you sleep.</p>
<p>Most indie makers are bought into this dream (trap). Most of us here hardly found any success. If one product fails, we go build an another one in a week, launch 12 startups in 12 months, do tiktok reels, shitpost in twitter, go viral on Reddit, etc, etc.</p>
<p>We’re stuck in an echo chamber. Wake up.</p>
<p>I haven’t built anything wildly successful yet — so this isn’t advice from someone who’s made it. I’m just in the same zone as many of you. But I can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right.</p>
<p>The more I scrolled Twitter and Reddit, the more my ideas started to orbit this tiny solar system of indie makers. It felt like I was building something valuable, but not really.</p>
<p>I started talking to friends, one is into mechanical tools and another runs an electronics blog — my ideas meant nothing to them or their business.</p>
<p>They were struggling with real stuff — inventory management, getting prospects, tracking employee attendance, delivery delays, managing cash flow. Not one of them cared about my Notion dashboard or AI-powered productivity tracker.</p>
<p>That was the slap.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to consciously spend less time on X and Reddit, and more time reading other news, talking to friends and business owners, attending real-world meetups, taking a tour of their offices. I’m asking questions, observing processes, and just trying to be useful. It’s reshaping how I think about products completely.</p>
<p>There’s a quote that floats around on Twitter - Build for people who don’t know what an API or AI wrapper is. That’s exactly what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong—this community is amazing and it got me started. I still love it. But if you’ve been here for months and you’re still building for other builders… maybe it’s time to zoom out.</p>
<p>Your next best idea might come from a casual chat with your barber — not from another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/">r&#x2F;SaaS</a> post.</p>
<p>Anyone else feeling this ?</p>
