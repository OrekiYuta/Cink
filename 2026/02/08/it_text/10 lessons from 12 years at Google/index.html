<h2 id="Lessons-I-learned-along-the-way"><a href="#Lessons-I-learned-along-the-way" class="headerlink" title="Lessons I learned along the way"></a>Lessons I learned along the way</h2><p>As I celebrate my 12th anniversary at Google, I find myself reflecting on the journey I’ve had so far. It’s been a decade filled with growth, challenges, and invaluable lessons that have shaped me not only as an engineer but also as a leader and a person.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to share <strong>10 key lessons</strong> I’ve learned during my time. These insights have fundamentally altered my approach to work, and I hope they resonate with fellow engineers, aspiring leaders, and anyone seeking to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: Embrace lifelong learning</strong></p>
<p>The first lesson I’ve learned is that continuous learning is the lifeblood of a thriving career. In many industries, staying stagnant is just not an option. Embracing a mindset of lifelong learning has been crucial to my growth.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful ways I’ve found to learn is by writing about what I’m learning. The process of explaining concepts to others forces me to deepen my own understanding and uncover gaps in my knowledge. It’s a humbling experience that reminds me to always remain curious and never assume I know everything.</p>
<p>As a senior leader, I’ve also realized the importance of modeling a growth mindset for my team. By admitting when I don’t know something and actively seeking out new learning opportunities, I create psychological safety for others to do the same. It fosters a culture where it’s okay to ask questions, make mistakes, and continuously improve.</p>
<p>Investing in your own growth and inspiring others to do the same is one of the most impactful things you can do as a leader. It creates a ripple effect of learning and development that benefits not only individuals but the entire organization.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Put users front and center</strong></p>
<p>The second lesson I’ve learned is the importance of putting users at the heart of everything we do. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new technologies and lose sight of who we’re actually building for. But the best engineers are obsessed with understanding and serving their users.</p>
<p>Putting users front and center means starting with empathy. It involves deeply understanding the problems users face and the impact our work can have on their lives. Regular user research, feedback sessions, and dogfooding our own products have been invaluable in keeping me grounded in user needs.</p>
<p>It’s also about making user-centric decisions at every stage of the development process. From ideation to design to implementation, every choice should be guided by the question: “How does this benefit our users?” Regularly stepping back and connecting the dots between day-to-day tasks and user impact keeps the bigger picture in focus.</p>
<p>By making user-centricity your north star, you ensure that you’re not just building cool things but building the right things that make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Collaborate to amplify impact</strong></p>
<p>The third lesson I’ve learned is that no engineer is an island. The most impressive achievements in our field are accomplished by teams, not individuals. Shifting from a “me” to a “we” mindset has been a game-changer in my career.</p>
<p>Collaborating effectively means being generous with your skills, knowledge, and insights. It involves actively seeking out opportunities to share what you know and learn from others, regardless of their level of seniority. Mentoring and being mentored have been equally valuable experiences for me.</p>
<p>When you focus on uplifting those around you and multiplying your impact through teamwork, you scale yourself and your influence exponentially. You create a network effect of growth and success that goes far beyond what you could achieve alone.</p>
<p>Collaboration also extends beyond your immediate team. Building strong relationships across functions and departments opens up new opportunities for impact and innovation. It allows you to tap into diverse perspectives and expertise that can take your work to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4: Just start. You can edit a bad page, not a blank one.</strong></p>
<p>The fourth lesson I’ve learned is the power of iteration. It’s a lesson encapsulated in the mantra: “First do it, then do it right, then do it better.” This approach has been transformative in my work as an engineer.</p>
<p>Often, the quest for perfection can be paralyzing. We get stuck in analysis paralysis, endlessly debating the best approach before taking any action. But the reality is, the perfect solution rarely emerges fully formed. It’s through the process of doing that we learn and improve.</p>
<p>The first step is to simply start. Take action, even if it’s not flawless. Get your minimum viable product out there and into the hands of users. This allows you to gather real-world feedback and validate your assumptions early on.</p>
<p>Next, focus on doing it right. Refine your approach based on what you’ve learned. Fix bugs, optimize for performance, and improve the user experience. This is where you start to build quality and reliability into your product.</p>
<p>Finally, continuously seek ways to do it better. Never settle for the status quo. Keep iterating, innovating, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Stay open to new ideas and technologies that could take your product to the next level.</p>
<p>By embracing the power of iteration, you cultivate a mindset of continuous improvement. You learn to embrace imperfection and view failures as opportunities for growth. Over time, this approach allows you to compound your impact and create truly remarkable products.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 5: Master the art of influence</strong></p>
<p>The fifth lesson I’ve learned is that the most effective engineers are also skilled influencers. Technical brilliance alone is not enough to drive impact at scale. You need to be able to communicate your ideas effectively, align stakeholders, and inspire action.</p>
<p>Mastering the art of influence starts with empathy. Seek to understand the perspectives, motivations, and concerns of those around you. Listen actively and ask questions to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and goals.</p>
<p>Tailor your communication style to your audience. When presenting to executives, focus on the strategic impact and business value of your work. When collaborating with cross-functional partners, emphasize how your efforts align with their priorities. When explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, use analogies and visuals to make the information accessible.</p>
<p>Building influence also involves establishing trust and credibility. Follow through on your commitments, admit when you’re wrong, and give credit where it’s due. Consistently demonstrating your expertise and reliability will make others more receptive to your ideas.</p>
<p>Remember that influence is not about manipulation or coercion. It’s about building genuine relationships, finding common ground, and inspiring others to action through authentic communication and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 6: Think strategically</strong></p>
<p>The sixth lesson I’ve learned is the importance of thinking strategically as you grow in your career. As your scope and impact expand, you need to develop the ability to see the big picture and make decisions with long-term success in mind.</p>
<p>Thinking strategically means understanding the full context in which your work operates. It involves considering not just the immediate problem at hand but also the broader systems, stakeholders, and industry trends that shape your environment.</p>
<p>Cultivate foresight by anticipating the downstream implications of your choices. Consider how your technical decisions today might impact scalability, maintainability, and user experience down the line. Proactively identify potential risks and opportunities, and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Thinking strategically also means aligning your efforts with the overarching goals and priorities of your organization. Understand how your work fits into the bigger picture and make decisions that drive the company forward.</p>
<p>Effective strategic thinking requires a blend of creativity and analytical rigor. It involves generating innovative ideas while also grounding them in data and practical constraints. Continuously seek out diverse perspectives and feedback to challenge your assumptions and strengthen your strategic vision.</p>
<p>As you develop your strategic thinking skills, you’ll become better equipped to navigate complexity, make trade-offs, and lead your team and organization to long-term success.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 7: Focus on what you can control</strong></p>
<p>The seventh lesson I’ve learned is the power of focusing on what you can control, especially in the face of uncertainty or challenges. As engineers, we often work on complex problems with many variables outside our direct influence. It can be tempting to get bogged down in frustration or anxiety over things we can’t change.</p>
<p>However, I’ve found that the most effective approach is to zero in on what’s within your sphere of control. While you can’t control external circumstances, you can always control your own response and actions.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, break it down into manageable pieces. Identify the specific actions you can take to move forward, no matter how small. Prioritize based on impact and feasibility, and focus your energy on the things you can directly influence.</p>
<p>This proactive, solution-oriented mindset is especially important during times of change or uncertainty. Instead of getting paralyzed by what-ifs or worst-case scenarios, channel your energy into creating positive outcomes within your control.</p>
<p>Focusing on what you can control also means letting go of perfectionism and embracing adaptability. Recognize that there will always be factors outside your control, and that’s okay. What matters is how you navigate them with resilience and grace.</p>
<p>By concentrating on what you can control, you cultivate a sense of agency and empowerment. You build momentum and maintain a positive outlook, even in the face of setbacks. Over time, this approach allows you to make steady progress and achieve your goals, one step at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 8: Communicate with clarity</strong></p>
<p>The eighth lesson I’ve learned is that communication is a superpower for engineers. The ability to articulate complex ideas in a clear, concise, and compelling way is what sets apart truly effective technical leaders.</p>
<p>Communicating with clarity starts with understanding your audience. Consider their background, expertise, and goals, and tailor your message accordingly. Use language that is accessible and free of unnecessary jargon.</p>
<p>When writing code comments or technical documentation, aim for simplicity and coherence. Explain not just what the code does but also why it does it. Provide examples and context to help readers understand the bigger picture.</p>
<p>When presenting your work to others, use visuals, analogies, and storytelling to make your ideas more engaging and memorable. Share the underlying principles, trade-offs, and impact of your work, not just the technical details.</p>
<p>Remember that communication is a two-way street. Listen actively to others and seek to understand their perspectives before responding. Ask clarifying questions and provide space for dialogue and feedback.</p>
<p>Effective communication also means being transparent and direct, even when delivering difficult news or feedback. Avoid sugarcoating or being vague. Instead, focus on specific, actionable insights delivered with empathy and respect.</p>
<p>By mastering the art of clear communication, you amplify your influence and impact as an engineer. You become better equipped to collaborate, persuade, and lead, both within your team and across the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 9: Build bridges, not silos</strong></p>
<p>The ninth lesson I’ve learned is the importance of building bridges, not silos. In today’s complex and interconnected world, the most impactful work happens at the intersections between disciplines, teams, and perspectives.</p>
<p>As engineers, it’s easy to get caught up in our own technical bubble. We can become isolated from other functions and lose sight of the bigger picture. However, I’ve found that actively cultivating relationships and collaborations across boundaries is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Building bridges starts with curiosity and empathy. Seek to understand the perspectives, needs, and constraints of those in other roles and departments. Put yourself in their shoes and look for ways to align your efforts towards shared goals.</p>
<p>Proactively reach out to colleagues in other teams and functions. Invite them to share their insights and feedback on your work. Look for opportunities to collaborate on cross-functional projects that create value for the entire organization.</p>
<p>When conflicts or misunderstandings arise, approach them with an open mind and a focus on finding win-win solutions. Listen actively, ask questions, and seek to understand the root causes behind differing viewpoints. Work together to find common ground and create alignment.</p>
<p>Building bridges also means fostering a culture of psychological safety and inclusivity. Encourage diverse perspectives and create space for everyone to contribute their ideas and expertise. Celebrate successes together and learn from failures as a team.</p>
<p>By breaking down silos and building bridges, you tap into the collective intelligence and creativity of your organization. You create a more collaborative, innovative, and impactful workplace culture that benefits everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 10: Invest in your well-being</strong></p>
<p>The final lesson I’ve learned is the importance of investing in your own well-being. As engineers, we often pride ourselves on our ability to work hard and push through challenges. However, sustainable high performance requires more than just technical skills. It requires intentional self-care and renewal.</p>
<p>Investing in your well-being means setting clear boundaries and priorities. It means knowing when to say no to projects or commitments that don’t align with your values or goals. It means carving out time for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits outside of work.</p>
<p>Prioritize activities that recharge your energy and bring you joy. Whether it’s spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or simply taking a walk in nature, make space for the things that nourish your soul.</p>
<p>Investing in your well-being also means cultivating resilience and adaptability. Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Develop a support network of mentors, peers, and friends who can offer guidance and encouragement during tough times.</p>
<p>As a leader, model healthy work-life integration for your team. Encourage them to prioritize their own well-being and create a culture that values self-care and personal growth. Recognize that happy, healthy teams are the foundation of sustainable success.</p>
<p>Remember that your worth as a person is not defined by your output as an engineer. Your value lies in your unique qualities, passions, and contributions to the world. By investing in your well-being, you bring your best self to your work and your life as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As I reflect on my 12 years at Google, I’m filled with gratitude for the journey I’ve had. The lessons I’ve learned about soft skills, leadership, and personal growth have been just as transformative as the technical skills I’ve acquired.</p>
