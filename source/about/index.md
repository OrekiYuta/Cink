# What is Cink?

**Cink** (*Capture / Comment / Context → Index → Think*) is an automated knowledge-capturing system that transforms your
reading into a living, searchable, and deployable knowledge base.

It automatically stores everything you read, versions your notes, and deploys them as a website — all with minimal
manual effort.

## Architecture

## Automated Knowledge Flow

1. **[Auto]** Use an RSS client or browser to follow information sources
2. **[Manual]** Read and process content
3. **[Manual]** Save the processed content into local Markdown files
4. **[Auto]** Local Git repository automatically commits and pushes changes to GitHub
5. **[Auto]** Vercel detects repository updates and deploys them as a website
