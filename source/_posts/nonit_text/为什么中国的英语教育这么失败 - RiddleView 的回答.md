 **Not just English education, but the whole ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM here have systematically failed to deliver any meaningful results**

Here’s the thing, the language itself never meant to be studied, but to be used. But, Yes, in order to understand all the innuendos and subtle differences between all those slangs, memes, and all those inside jokes and references, you do need to understand the context and the culture behind them. But it’s takes time and there’s no way around them.

中国大陆把全部的教育资源全部 focus on Grammar & Reading. 而中国教育中的 reading 全都不是英国和美国的文化，全部都是中国大陆的东西，硬创造一些英文里本身没有的东西，那么学这些东西的学生英文怎么可能好，更何况 The lack of real life experience in listening and speaking. There’s no way people can understand whatever how native speakers speak. Cuz they don’t use English even on the textbooks. Also, tbh, as an English speaker, we really don’t care about your culture……It’s just never make it to the mainstream for a reason. They are bored as F\*\*k, it’s a novelty, not a necessity.

Grammar itself just isn’t important, no one cares in everyday lives, no one uses them like how it is. How people use them in speaking language just has a totally different rule. The context itself is much more important than grammar.

 **English is a language and a tool for the real world and real people. It’s never like calculus and physics, there’s no right answer to anything. The English itself is also a very malleable language, cuz there’s immigrants who use it everyday creating new meaning for old expression. You, as a Chinese student still learning about the words from 60 or 70 years ago, it’s old and outdated. Most people can’t even order food in a casual restaurant**
