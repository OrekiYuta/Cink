I discovered the Indie Hacking community in March 2024 and got totally sucked in by the dream — build a small product, make a living online, while you are free and travel anywhere.

Building in public, fellow makers cheering on your small wins, supportive communities, growing a following - It all felt like I’d finally found my people.

But around 10 months in, something is starting to feel off.

It started to feel like it's a weird kind of ponzi scheme — indie makers building tools for other indie makers, trying to sell shovels, selling the dream of build it fast and make money while you sleep.

Most indie makers are bought into this dream (trap). Most of us here hardly found any success. If one product fails, we go build an another one in a week, launch 12 startups in 12 months, do tiktok reels, shitpost in twitter, go viral on Reddit, etc, etc.

We’re stuck in an echo chamber. Wake up.

I haven’t built anything wildly successful yet — so this isn’t advice from someone who's made it. I’m just in the same zone as many of you. But I can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right.

The more I scrolled Twitter and Reddit, the more my ideas started to orbit this tiny solar system of indie makers. It felt like I was building something valuable, but not really.

I started talking to friends, one is into mechanical tools and another runs an electronics blog — my ideas meant nothing to them or their business.

They were struggling with real stuff — inventory management, getting prospects, tracking employee attendance, delivery delays, managing cash flow. Not one of them cared about my Notion dashboard or AI-powered productivity tracker.

That was the slap.

Since then, I’ve been trying to consciously spend less time on X and Reddit, and more time reading other news, talking to friends and business owners, attending real-world meetups, taking a tour of their offices. I’m asking questions, observing processes, and just trying to be useful. It’s reshaping how I think about products completely.

There’s a quote that floats around on Twitter - Build for people who don’t know what an API or AI wrapper is. That’s exactly what I’m talking about.

Don’t get me wrong—this community is amazing and it got me started. I still love it. But if you’ve been here for months and you’re still building for other builders… maybe it’s time to zoom out.

Your next best idea might come from a casual chat with your barber — not from another [r/SaaS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/) post.

Anyone else feeling this ?
