## AI isn't taking your job. It's making your expertise worthless while you watch. The three things everyone tries that fail, and the one strategy that actually works

You open your laptop Monday morning with a question you can’t shake: *Will I still have a job that matters in two years?*

Not whether you’ll be employed, but whether the work you do will still mean something.

Last week, you spent three hours writing a campaign brief. You saw a colleague generate something 80% as good in four minutes using an AI agent (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT…). Maybe 90% as good if you’re being honest.

You still have your job. But you can feel it shrinking around you.

The problem isn’t that the robots are coming. **It’s that you don’t know what you’re supposed to be good at anymore.** That Excel expertise you built over five years? Automated. Your ability to research competitors and synthesize findings? There’s an agent for that. Your skill at writing clear project updates? Gone.

You’re losing your professional identity faster than you can rebuild it. And nobody’s telling you what comes next.

## The Three Things Everyone Tries That Don’t Actually Work

When you feel your value eroding, you do what seems rational. You adapt, you learn, and you try to stay relevant.

**First**, you learn to use the AI tools better. You take courses on prompt engineering. You master ChatGPT, Claude, whatever new platform launches next week and the week after. You become the “AI person” on your team. You think that ***if I can’t beat them, I’ll use them better than anyone else.***

This fails because you’re still competing on execution speed. You’re just a faster horse. And execution is exactly what’s being commoditized. Six months from now, the tools will be easier to use. Your “expertise” in prompting becomes worthless the moment the interface improves. You’ve learned to use the shovel better, but the backhoe is coming anyway.

**Second**, you double down on your existing expertise. The accountant learns more advanced tax code. The designer masters more software. The analyst builds more complex models. You will have the same thought as many others, “ *I’ll go so deep they can’t replace me*.”

This fails because depth in a disappearing domain is a trap. You’re building a fortress in a flood zone. Agents aren’t just matching human expertise at the median level anymore. They’re rapidly approaching expert-level performance in narrow domains. Your specialized knowledge becomes a liability because you’ve invested everything in something that’s actively being automated. You’re becoming the world’s best telegraph operator in 1995.

**Third**, you try to “stay human” through soft skills. You lean into creativity, empathy, relationship building. You go to workshops on emotional intelligence. You focus on being irreplaceably human. You might think that what makes us human can’t be automated.

This fails because it’s too vague to be actionable. [What does “be creative” actually mean when an AI can generate 100 ideas in 10 seconds?](https://newsletter.jantegze.com/p/youre-not-getting-worse-everyone-else-got-ai) How do you monetize empathy when your job is to produce reports? The advice feels right but provides no compass. You end up doing the same tasks you always did, just with more anxiety and a vaguer sense of purpose.

The real issue with all three approaches is that **they’re reactions, not redesigns**. You’re trying to adapt your old role to a new reality. What actually works is building an entirely new role that didn’t exist before.

But nobody’s teaching you what that looks like.

## The Economic Logic Working Against You

This isn’t happening to you because you’re failing to adapt. It’s happening because the economic incentive structure is perfectly designed to create this problem.

The mechanism is simple, **companies profit immediately from adopting [AI agents](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents)**. Every task automated results in cost reduction. The CFO sees the spreadsheet, where one AI subscription replaces 40% of a mid-level employee’s work. The math is simple, and the decision is obvious.

Many people hate to hear that. But if they owned the company or sat in leadership, they’d do the exact same thing. Companies exist to drive profit, just as employees work to drive higher salaries. That’s how the system has worked for centuries.

But companies don’t profit from retraining you for a higher-order role that doesn’t exist yet.

Why? Because that new role is undefined, unmeasured, and uncertain. You can’t put “figure out what humans should do now” on a quarterly earnings call. You can’t show ROI on “redesign work itself.” Short-term incentives win. Long-term strategy loses.

Nobody invests in the 12-24 month process of discovering what your new role should be because there’s no immediate return on that investment.

We’re in a speed mismatch. **Agent capabilities are compounding at 6-12 month cycles.** Human adaptation through traditional systems operates on 2-5 year cycles.

Universities can’t redesign curricula fast enough. They’re teaching skills that will be automated before students graduate. Companies can’t retrain fast enough. By the time they identify the new skills needed and build a program, the landscape has shifted again. You can’t pivot fast enough. Career transitions take time. Mortgages don’t wait.

**We’ve never had to do this before.**

Previous automation waves happened in manufacturing. You could see the factory floor. You could watch jobs disappear and new ones emerge. There was geographic and temporal separation.

This is different, knowledge work is being automated while you’re still at your desk. The old role and new role exist simultaneously in the same person, the same company, the same moment.

And nobody has an economic incentive to solve it. Companies maximize value through cost reduction, not workforce transformation. Educational institutions are too slow and too far removed from real-time market needs. Governments don’t understand the problem yet. You’re too busy trying to keep your current job to redesign your future one.

The system isn’t helping because it isn’t designed for continuous, rapid role evolution; it is designed for stability.

**We’re using industrial-era institutions to solve an exponential-era problem**. That’s why you feel stuck.

## Your Experience Just Became Worthless (The Timeline)

Let me tell you a story of my friend, let’s call her Sarah (Her real name is Katřina, but the Czech diacritic is tricky for many). She was a senior research analyst at a mid-sized consulting firm. Ten years of experience. Her job was provide answers to the client companies, who would ask questions like “What’s our competitor doing in the Asian market?” and she’d spend 2-3 weeks gathering data, reading reports, interviewing experts, synthesizing findings, and creating presentations.

She was good, clients loved her work, and she billed at $250 an hour.

The firm deployed an AI research agent in Q2 2023. Not to replace her, but as they said, to “augment” her. Management said all the right things about human-AI collaboration.

The agent could do Sarah’s initial research in 90 minutes, it would scan thousands of sources, identify patterns, generate a first-draft report.

**Month one:** Sarah was relieved and thought she could focus on high-value synthesis work. She’d take the agent’s output and refine it, add strategic insights, make it client-ready.

**Month three**: A partner asked her, “Why does this take you a week now? The AI gives us 80% of what we need in an hour. What’s the other 20% worth?”

Sarah couldn’t answer clearly. Because sometimes the agent’s output only needed light editing. Sometimes her “strategic insights” were things the agent had already identified, just worded differently.

**Month six**: The firm restructured. They didn’t fire Sarah, they changed her role to “Quality Reviewer.” She now oversaw the AI’s output for 6-8 projects simultaneously instead of owning 2-3 end to end.

Her title stayed the same. Her billing rate dropped to $150 an hour. Her ten years of experience felt worthless.

Sarah tried everything. She took an AI prompt engineering course. She tried to go deeper into specialized research methodologies. She emphasized her client relationships. None of it mattered because the firm had already made the economic calculation.

One AI subscription costs $50 a month. Sarah’s salary: $140K a year. The agent didn’t need to be perfect; it just needed to be 70% as good at 5% of the cost. But it was fast, faster than her.

The part that illustrates the systemic problem, you often hear from AI vendors that, thanks to their AI tools, people can focus on higher-value work. But when pressed on what that meant specifically, they’d go vague. Strategic thinking, client relationships, creative problem solving.

**Nobody could define what higher-value work actually looked like in practice**. Nobody could describe the new role. So they defaulted to the only thing they could measure: cost reduction.

Sarah left six months later. The firm hired two junior analysts at $65K each to do what she did. With the AI, they’re 85% as effective as Sarah was.

Sarah’s still trying to figure out what she’s supposed to be good at. Last anyone heard, she’s thinking about leaving the industry entirely.

## Stop Trying to Be Better at Your Current Job

The people who are winning aren’t trying to be better at their current job. They’re building new jobs that combine human judgment with agent capability.

Not becoming prompt engineers, not becoming AI experts. Becoming orchestrators who use agents to do what was previously impossible at their level.

Marcus (real name Zdeněk) was a marketing strategist at a retail company. When AI tools emerged, he didn’t try to write better marketing copy than the AI. He started running 50 campaign variations simultaneously. Something that would’ve required a team of 12 people before.

He’d use agents to generate the variations, test them, analyze results, and iterate. His job was to design the testing framework, analyze the patterns the agents uncovered, and make strategic decisions based on data no human could manually process.

Within six months, his campaigns were outperforming competitors by 40%. Not because he was better at any single task. Because he could operate at a scale that was previously impossible.

This is a pattern that works. Find the constraint in your domain that exists because of human limitations. *What doesn’t get done because it takes too long? What questions don’t get asked because analysis is too expensive? What experiments don’t get run because you’d need a team of 20?*

Then use agents to remove that constraint, not to speed up your current tasks. To do things that were previously impossible.

Then build expertise in the judgment layer. *What experiments should we run? Which patterns matter? What do these results mean for strategy? When should we override the agent’s recommendation?*

This isn’t vague strategic thinking. It’s specific, you’re the decision maker orchestrating a capability that didn’t exist before.

You’re not competing with the agent. **You’re creating a new capability that requires both you and the agent.** You’re not defensible because you’re better at the task. You’re defensible because you’ve built something that only exists with you orchestrating it.

**This requires letting go of your identity as “the person who does X.”** Marcus doesn’t write copy anymore. That bothered him at first. He liked writing. But he likes being valuable more.

Here’s what you can do this month:

**Week one**: Identify one thing in your job that you’d do 10x more if it didn’t take so long. Customer research? Competitive analysis? Testing variations? Data modeling?

**Week two**: Use AI agents to do that thing at 10x volume, even if quality drops to 70%. See what becomes possible.

**Week three:** Find the patterns. What insights emerge at scale that you’d never see doing it manually? What new questions can you answer?

**Week four**: Pitch this as a new capability to your boss. Not “I’m more efficient now.” But “We can now do this specific thing we couldn’t do before, which creates this specific business value.”

People who do this aren’t getting squeezed. They’re getting promoted or poached. Because they’ve made themselves the linchpin of a new capability, not the executor of an old task.

**One critical caveat**, this won’t work forever in its current form. Eventually, agents will get better at orchestration too. But it buys you three to five years. And in that time, you’ll see the next evolution coming.

The meta-skill is this: **learning to spot what becomes possible when a constraint disappears**, then building your value around that new possibility.

## Most Strategic Thinking Was Actually Just Thoroughness

Many people currently doing “strategic” knowledge work aren’t actually that strategic.

When agents started handling the execution layer, everyone assumed humans would naturally move up to higher-order thinking. Strategy, judgment, and vision.

But a different reality is emerging, many senior people with years of experience can’t actually operate at that level. Their expertise was mostly pattern matching and process execution dressed up in strategic language.

“ *We thought Lisa was a strategic thinker because her analyses were thorough. Turns out the thoroughness was the skill. When an agent can be thorough in three minutes, we’re discovering Lisa doesn’t actually have strategic insights to add*.”

This isn’t that these people are bad at their jobs. They were excellent at their jobs. The job required diligence, attention to detail, process mastery. They delivered exactly what was asked.

But the industry sold them on the idea that experience equals strategic capability. That putting in the hours would naturally develop judgment. For some people, it did. For many others, they got really good at execution and called it strategy.

Here is what one CEO (he didn’t want me share his name) of a mid-sized company in Canada told me: “ *We’re discovering that our senior people and our junior people are equally lost when we ask them what we should do, not just how to do it. The seniors are just more articulate about their uncertainty.*“

The agent economy isn’t just automating tasks. It’s revealing who was coasting on the appearance of strategic thinking versus who actually possesses it.

And there’s no gentle way to tell someone, but you’ve spent 15 years building a career, and we’re just now realizing the thing you were good at wasn’t what we actually needed.

Nobody says this publicly because it suggests the problem isn’t just technological adaptation. It’s that our evaluation systems were broken all along. We promoted people for the wrong reasons. We confused “does the work well” with “thinks strategically about the work.”

Admitting that means admitting we don’t actually know how to identify or develop real strategic capability. We’ve been guessing, using credentials and years of experience as proxies.

## The Only Durable Strategy Is Spotting What Just Became Possible

You’re not going to solve this by being better at your current job. That job is dissolving under you in real time.

You’re not going to solve it by learning the tools better. The tools will get easier to use without you.

You’re not going to solve it by going deeper into your specialty. That specialty is being automated.

What works is this: **become the person who spots what just became possible and builds your value around that new capabilit** y. Use agents to remove constraints that previously limited what you could do. Become the orchestrator of scale that didn’t exist before.

This isn’t a permanent solution. In three to five years, you’ll need to do it again. **The meta-skill is learning to continuously spot the next evolution and position yourself at the edge of what’s newly possible**.

This will separate people who were genuinely strategic from people who were just thorough. There’s no way around that. The system that rewarded thoroughness is breaking down. The new system rewards the ability to see what constraints just disappeared and build something new in that space.

You still have time, but not much. The speed mismatch between agent capability and human adaptation is real. The companies won’t save you because they’re optimized for short-term cost reduction, not long-term workforce transformation. The educational system won’t save you because it’s too slow.

You have to save yourself. And the way you do that is by stopping trying to defend your current role and starting to build the role that didn’t exist six months ago.

Monday morning will keep coming. The question is whether you’re still wondering what you’re supposed to be good at, or whether you’ve already built the answer.
